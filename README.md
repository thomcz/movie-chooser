# movie-chooser
This app is supposed to help a group of people to find a movie to watch.
To do so, users can create or join a room. After they entered a room they can search for movies and suggest them. 
Finally, they can vote for one of the movies or the app can choose one random movie.
The [frontend](https://github.com/thomcz/movie-chooser/tree/master/client) is an Angular app and the [backend](https://github.com/thomcz/movie-chooser/tree/master/server) is a nodejs server connected to a mongodb database.
